        <h2>WRC</h2>
        <p>The World Rally Championship has certain cars the drivers are allowed to be used.
        This is to ensure fairness among competitors, since thousands of dollars are on the line.
        </p>
        <p>The cars inlude:</p>
        <ul class="carlist">
            <li>HYUNDAI I20</li>
            <li>VOLKSWAGEN POLO R</li>
            <li>CITROEN DS3</li>
            <li>FORD FIESTA RS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of the cars are turbo, and either AWD or 4WD. This is to make sure that maximum traction can be achieved for the majority
        of the time. Front brake bias (bigger brakes in the front) helps when cornering.</p>
        
        <h2>Rally America</h2>
        <p>Rally America is in charge of the rally championship in America. They host rallies all over the country, from Oregon to Michigan.
        International racers and local racers are allowed to compete for the championship if their cars meet the standards.</p>
        <p>Instead of only having certain cars that you can use, Rally America has different 'classes' for cars to be in. </p>
        <p>Rally America has 3 main classes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open class,</li>
            <li>Super production class,</li>
            <li> 2WD class</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Open class</h3>
        <p>This very broad class allows for a tremendous amount of technical innovation. As with all performance rally classes, the cars must retain their production based appearance, but under the hood, virtually anything goes, 
        turbo charging and all wheel drive are absolutely essential</p>

        <h3>Super Production class</h3>
        <p>For modern, high performance all wheel drive vehicles with very limited modifications.  Only a small step down in speed from Open Class, but a large step down in competitor cost. 
        The primary difference is the allowance for brake modifications in Super Production enabling modern cars with large brakes to fit smaller brake systems to fit 15 inch gravel rally wheels and tires.</p>

        <h3>2 Wheel Drive class</h3>
        <p>'Spectacular' describes a class where power is effectively restricted only by the limitations of 2 wheel drive.  Big turbos, big engines, and big 'rooster tails' of dirt rule this class.</p>
       <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/89/df/a3/89dfa3b5fed8b1f6a4621d17a15548b4.jpg">
       
       <p class="lastp">There is small class inside of the open class, group 2.
       A normally aspirated, small displacement, two-wheel drive class that otherwise follows the 'anything goes' format of the Open and Group 5 classes, 
       but provides excellent competition opportunities for cost sensitive competitors and manufacturers.</p>
