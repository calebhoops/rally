        <p>It may not look like much from an outward appearance, but rally cars have a lot 
        going on under the hood.</p>
        <h2>Suspension/Brakes</h2>
        <p>The stock suspension on the car is completely removed to start with. When it comes down to it, suspension is 
        what seperates a track car from a rally car. Most rally cars have coilovers instead of standard shocks/struts.</p>

        <p>Brakes. Brakes are the most important next to suspension. Easily one of the most expensive components of a rally, a quality brake system 
        is vital to a drivers safety. Most brake systems are drilled and have extra large calipers.</p>

        <h2>Engine/Transmission</h2>
        <p class="lastp">A good amount of mods are done to the engine. One of the biggest is an ALS. Anti lag system is responsible for keeping the turbo 
        spooled, even when the throttle is closed. To tell if an ALS system is working properly, flames will shoot of the tail
        pipe when gears are switched.</p>
        <p class="lastp">The transmission is swapped for a sequential transmission. A sequential transmission 
        puts the gearbox in a staight line, instead of an 'H'. This makes shifting faster, and easier for the driver.</p>

        <p class="lastp">Turbos are also very important to a rally car. Most rally cars 
        have td05 turbos that add about 250+ hp. Big intercoolers are needed to cool big turbos. Intercoolers can either be top or front mount.
        In some cases, they are mounted in the rear. You can tell if a rally car has a top intercooler by the a hood
        scoop. You can tell if there is rear intercooler by looking at the rally car's rear fenders. If there is one, there will be vents on the 
        fenders. </p>

        <h2>Tires</h2>
        <p>Rally cars use special tires to get maximum grip, as well as durability.
        These tires are usually called 'gravel tires'.</p>

        <p>And last but not least, all rally cars have an 8 point roll cage that 
        is welded to the frame of the car.</p>
